## Introduction 

It is located inside Beckley Creek Park in Louisville, KY. The Egg Lawn alone is 22 acres. Construction started on the parks in 2011 and opened in November 2012. It is just one small part of four major parks in Louisville all connected by a park drive, a trail system, and a water trail. A quick summary of the master plan of the Parklands includes:
- 100 miles of trails for biking, walking, etc.
- 19 miles for canoeing on the Floyds Fork Creek
- Locations to host events such as the PNC Achievement Center and the Gheens Foundation Lodge which are both located next to the Egg Lawn
- Playgrounds and sprayground for families
- Dog parks called the "Barklands"
